## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Daisuke Nishino, I was experienced the development of the application infrastructure of a large-scale system for agency of nonlife insurance. Afterward, based on this experience, in charge of support engineer of microsoft technologies such as ".NET development or some of the major Windows platform's functions and roles" at production engineering department of system integrator in Japan.

In 2014, I released OpenTouryo, which consolidates our knowledge of system integration, and that is infrastructure that is consysted template and tools for the large-scale enterprise business applications development as OSS.

Since 2015,, in charge of the measures of productivity improvement of systems integration using cloud technology, and developing authentication system of OAuth2.0/OIDC. And, I began developing templates for develop hybrid mobile application and backend Web API that considered authentication, but it's stopped.

This is because, the wave of digital transformation has come since 2020. I started with Apache Spark for big data and then moved on to IoT and data pipelines, but I eventually realized it was important to get involved in BI/AI, so I devoted myself to machine learning, deep learning, and obtaining JDLA-E certification.

As a result, I am now able to develop business applications using C#, develop based on web architectures using JavaScript and other tools, and conduct data scientist-style research using Python and other tools.
