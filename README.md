## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Daisuke Nishino. Initially 2000, I was involved in the development of application infrastructure for a large-scale system for a non-life insurance agency. Based on this experience, I later worked as a support engineer for Microsoft technologies, including .NET development and major Windows platform functions, in the production engineering department of a system integrator company in Japan.

In 2014, I released OpenTouryo, an open-source infrastructure consisting of templates and tools designed for developing large-scale enterprise business applications. It consolidates our knowledge and experience in system integration.

Since 2015, I have been responsible for improving productivity in system integration using cloud technologies and developing authentication systems based on OAuth 2.0 and OIDC. I also started developing templates for hybrid mobile applications and backend Web APIs with integrated authentication, though this development has since been paused.

With the rise of digital transformation around 2020, I shifted my focus to big data technologies, beginning with Apache Spark, then expanding into IoT and data pipelines. Eventually, I realized the importance of BI and AI, so I dedicated myself to machine learning, deep learning, and obtained the JDLA-E certification.

As a result, I can now develop business applications using C#, build web architecture-based applications using JavaScript and related tools, and conduct data science research using Python and other tools.
